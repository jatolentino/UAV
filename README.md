# UAV Control

The goal of this project is to control the autonomous navigation of a drone, making use of the equations that describe its atitude and position such as any user can upload a path using coordinates, weight points or 3D trajectories expressed in equations.
# Matlab/Octave simulation
As an initial approach to simulate the drone navigation, the softwares Octave or Matlab have been utilized to provide trajectories and compute the equations of the state-space model. Due to the high non-linearities of the plant, a novel control method is yet to be tested and possibly compared against traditional control algorithms.  

The goal of this project is to control the autonomous navigation of a drone, making use of the equations that describe its atitude and position such as any user can upload a path using coordinates, weight points or 3D trajectories expressed in equations.
